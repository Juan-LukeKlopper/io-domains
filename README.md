# IO domains on polygon

This is a project which will allow users to create their own domain name ending in .io which is linked to their public key. This allows users to give someone a human readable address that is easy to remember instead of a long confusing public key.

This project uses React, Hardhat, Node.js and the Polygon mumbai testnet.
